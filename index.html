Create a cinematic, explosive, high-energy birthday website for a boy named Virat using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks).

The website should feel like a movie trailer intro mixed with a powerful celebration blast.

REQUIREMENTS:

1. Start with a completely dark screen.
2. Add subtle floating glowing particles in the background.
3. Show dramatic fading text:
   "The King Was Born..."
   Then fade out slowly.

4. Add heartbeat sound for 3 seconds.
5. Suddenly trigger a massive explosion transition:
   - Bright flash
   - Screen shake effect
   - Fire burst animation

6. After explosion, reveal glowing neon text:
   "HAPPY BIRTHDAY VIRAT 🔥👑"
   The text should:
   - Glow in red and gold
   - Have pulsing animation
   - Slight floating movement
   - Fire sparks around it

7. Add continuous background effects:
   - Fireworks animation
   - Confetti rain
   - Slow color-shifting gradient background
   - Subtle smoke/fire particles

8. Add a glowing animated button:
   "Reveal The Legend 🎉"

9. When the button is clicked:
   - Zoom-in transition
   - Cinematic background music starts
   - Fade into full-screen emotional birthday message
   - Typing animation effect
   - Sparkle animations

10. The birthday message should:
   - Be powerful and motivating
   - Celebrate strength, growth, ambition
   - Mention dreams, discipline, hard work
   - Feel inspiring and confident
   - Not childish, but king-like energy

11. Make everything mobile responsive.
12. Use smooth animations and clean modern UI.
13. Keep code structured and well organized.

The final result should feel like a movie-level birthday celebration for a future legend.
